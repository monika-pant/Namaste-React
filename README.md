\-------------------------

## package.json

- package.json is a configuration file for NPM (Node Package Manager) that contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and version.
- It's used to manage project dependencies, scripts, and versioning.
- A well-structured package.json file is essential for maintaining a healthy and scalable project.
- It's also used by package managers like npm and yarn to install dependencies.

## Dependencies

- Dependencies are categorized into two types: **devDependencies** and **dependencies**.
- **devDependencies** are required for development environments, such as testing frameworks and code linters.
- **dependencies** are required for production environments, such as libraries and frameworks used in the application.
- Understanding the difference between these two types of dependencies is crucial for optimizing project performance and security.

## Versioning

\-------------

## Caret (^)

- The caret symbol (^) is used to specify a version range that allows for updates to the minor version and patch version.
- For example, ^1.2.3 would allow updates to 1.2.4, 1.3.0, but not 2.0.0.
- Using the caret symbol provides flexibility for updating dependencies while minimizing breaking changes.

## Tilde (~)

- The tilde symbol (~) is used to specify a version range that allows for updates to the patch version.
- For example, ~1.2.3 would allow updates to 1.2.4, but not 1.3.0 or 2.0.0.
- Using the tilde symbol provides a more conservative approach to updating dependencies, reducing the risk of breaking changes.

## Package Lock

\----------------

- package-lock.json is a file generated by npm that keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies installed in the project.
- It ensures that the same versions of dependencies are installed across different environments, including development, staging, and production.
- The package-lock.json file is essential for maintaining consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

## Node Modules

\----------------

- Node modules are packages installed using npm or yarn that provide reusable functionality for JavaScript applications.
- Node modules can be installed globally or locally, depending on the project requirements.
- Understanding how to manage node modules is crucial for maintaining a healthy and scalable project.

## Transitive Dependencies

- Transitive dependencies are dependencies that are installed as dependencies of other dependencies.
- For example, if a project depends on parcel, and parcel depends on webpack, then webpack is a transitive dependency of the project.
- Understanding transitive dependencies is important for optimizing project performance and security.

## Episode 4

## Compoennt

- A component is a normal JS function returning JSX.
- There are class based components and functional components.

## Props

- Props (short for "properties") are arguments passed to a React component.
- Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are passed to a component.
- Understanding how to work with props is essential for building reusable and maintainable React components.

## Key

- In React, a key is a unique identifier assigned to an element in an array.
- Keys help React keep track of elements and their positions in the array.
- Understanding how to use keys correctly is important for maintaining performance and preventing bugs in React applications.

## Episode 5

## Code Restructuring

- Code restructuring is the process of reorganizing code to make it more maintainable, scalable, and efficient.
- Code restructuring can involve breaking down large components into smaller ones, simplifying complex logic, and removing unnecessary code.
- Regular code restructuring is essential for maintaining a healthy and scalable project.

## Best Practice: Organizing Code

- One popular way to organize code is to create a src folder that contains all the source code for the project.
- Within the src folder, code can be organized into subfolders based on functionality, such as components, containers, actions, and reducers.
- Following a consistent code organization pattern makes it easier for developers to navigate and maintain the codebase.

## **Type of export** :

**Default import/export :** when we are exporting single thing from a file ex; in a component file

- export default myData;
- import myData from "my_file_path";

**Named import/export :** when we have to export multiple things from a file
we use named export

- export const CDN_URL;
- import {CDN_URL} from "my_file_path";

## **React Hooks**

A simple javascript function given to us by react which has it own usecase.

- When evr a state variable is updated react rerenders the component, as soon as my data layer changes my UI layer is also changed as react rerenders it.
  **Reconciliation algorithm/React Fibre**
  An algo used by react to diff and rerender the UI in a faster and efficient manner.Came in react-16
  **Virtual DOM**
  Representation of an actual DOM, its an object and normal JS object
  finding out diff b/w two JS objects is faster as compared to HTML and hence it makes an obj representation of the actual DOM.
  **Diff Algorithm**
  Find outs the difference between old and new virtual DOM.

**USE EFFECT**

- A normal JS function given by react with some specific usecase, it takes two arguments
- Callback function and a dependency array:
  useeffect(()=>{
  console.log("useeffect called");
  },[])
- when there is no dependency array, useeffect is called every time the component renders
- use effect is called on initial render and just once when the dependency array is empty array[]
- if we put something inside the dependency array is present , useffect is called every time the dependency changes
- used to call local state variable inside the functional component.
- **never create state variables/hooks inside if/else block, for loop , or a function , react will mess up with the code.**

whenever u change the local state variable, reconciliation algo runs and react rerenders the whole component.

**React Routing**

- To introduce routing we need to form routing configuration
- Routing configuration is done in index file.
- react router dom gives a utility/hook for errors=> useRouteError().
- In order to intact the header we need to have children routing
- Never ever use an anchor tag while using react, it will refresh the whole page.
- <link> component is the superpower given by react
- **There are 2 types of routing :**
- Client side routing : HTML page is being served by the client, all routing configurations and routes are present in client side code.
- Server side routing: HTML page served by server
- **Dynamic route and Load content inside it:**
- **UseParam Hook:** used to read the params in react

**Class BAsed components**

- Whenever a class is instantiated a constructor is called\*\*
- when a Class is loaded, the constructor is called.
- **Never** ever compare react class component with functional compoennets
<!--
if we follow the below order to call the components
<parent>
<child prop1/>
<child prop2/>
<parent/>
React will give preference to the render phase and merge the rendering of child component
this wil optimise the lifecycle
-->

## Optimising the code

- Following SOLID principles, single responsibility principal: one component is responsible for only one thing.
- **Hooks** utility functions provided by react

## Butifying the application | using CSS libraries

**TAILWIND CSS**

- CSS library
- need to install the tailwind CSS using npm/npx
- we can use various libraries like material UI that provides the ready made react components.
- tailwind CSS used POSTCSS behind the scene, this is a tool that is used to transform CSS into javascript.
